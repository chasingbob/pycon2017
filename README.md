## Resources

My talk relied heavily on the two tutorials below:

* [A Beginner's Guide to Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks](https://adeshpande3.github.io/adeshpande3.github.io/A-Beginner%27s-Guide-To-Understanding-Convolutional-Neural-Networks/)

* [An Intuitive Explanation of Convolutional Neural Networks](https://ujjwalkarn.me/2016/08/11/intuitive-explanation-convnets/)


For a more complete list of resources I maintain:

* [Deep Learning Resources](https://github.com/chasingbob/deep-learning-resources)

What does the democratization of AI mean to you and I?

* [Deep Learning - a gentle dive](https://becominghuman.ai/deep-learning-a-gentle-dive-92054e39bd8)
